## Sample Course
The app includes a built-in sample course for testing, containing 12 waypoints from a sailing track in Western Australia. This course is automatically available in the course selection menu and doesn't require syncing via Garmin Connect.

Sample course waypoints include:
- Start/Finish markers
- Navigation buoys (Parker, Mosman, Suicide, etc.)
- Turning marks (Miller, Armstrong, Dolphin West, etc.)
- Bricklanding markers

The sample course data is embedded in [SampleCourse.mc](source/SampleCourse.mc) and was imported from [_TrackSample.gpx](../SampleTracks/_TrackSample.gpx).
